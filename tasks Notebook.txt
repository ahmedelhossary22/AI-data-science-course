Low-Level Languages : are close to machine hardware They are fast but harder to understand and write as Machine Language  and Assembly Language

High-Level Languages: are closer to human language They are easier to read and  write as Python , Java and C++

Compiled  : The whole program is translated into machine code before execution as c++ You write code then The compiler converts it into an executable file 

Interpreted : The code is executed line by line like Python that reads and executes each line immediately

Programming Languages : Used to build complete software systems and applications like java that Used to build Android apps and enterprise systems 

Scripted Languages : Used mainly to automate tasks or control other programs Like JavaScript Used inside browsers to make websites interactive

Open Source : The source code is publicly available. Anyone can modify it

Not Open Source : The source code is private and owned by a company 

Supporting OOP : Supports Object-Oriented Programming concepts like:
Classes
Objects
Inheritance
Polymorphism 

Not Supporting OOP : Does not use objects and classes

float (Single-Precision): 4 bytes of memory, 6–7 decimal places of precision, fastest performance, suitable for graphics or cases where slight approximation is fine

double (Double-Precision): 8 bytes of memory, 15–16 decimal places of precision, commonly the default for real numbers

decimal (High Precision): 16 bytes of memory, 28–29 significant digits. Unlike float and double which are binary floating-point types (approximations),
decimal is a decimal floating-point type, making it accurate for monetary calculations

when to use ??

float : Graphics/games (3D positions), high-performance scientific simulations where exactness is less important than speed

Double: Scientific/engineering calculations, general-purpose programming

Decimal: Financial applications, accounting, or anything requiring exact, high-precision decimal representation
